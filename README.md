# FlightReady

To run this app, you must set the environment variable DATABASE_URL before starting.
One way to do this is to add a line like the following to a local file (e.g. "secrets.sh")
and source that file before starting up:

export DATABASE_URL='sqlite:///FlightReady.db'

(See related notes in the file "README_Flask-User-starter-app.md".)
